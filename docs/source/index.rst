SignalForge documentation
=========================

SignalForge is an open-source Python package that provides a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing and generating non-Gaussian, non-stationary signals in engineering applications. While traditional signal processing methods often rely on assumptions of Gaussianity and stationarity, real-world signals—especially those found in mechanical systems—frequently deviate from these idealized models. SignalForge bridges this gap by offering advanced, yet user-friendly tools to simulate, inspect, and manipulate signals with complex statistical properties. Whether you're designing loads for testing, exploring time-varying behavior, or developing new algorithms, SignalForge enables you to work with signals that better reflect real operating conditions. Built with extensibility and clarity in mind, the package is suitable for researchers, practitioners, and students working across mechanical engineering, signal processing, and beyond.
